This system is ideal for industrial, laboratory, and maintenance applications where the removal of residues, oils, greases, and microscopic particles is essential. The unit consists of a stainless steel tank, high-frequency ultrasonic generators, heating elements, temperature and time control systems, and an intuitive user interface. The combination of mechanical action from ultrasonic waves and elevated temperature enhances cleaning efficiency, reducing operation time and the need for harsh chemical agents. Key Features: Tank capacity: 81 l Ultrasonic frequency: 40 kHz Temperature range: ambient to 80\u202f\u00b0C Digital control of time and temperature Corrosion-resistant stainless steel structure Safety system with overheating protection Integrated automation, including: Automatic startup with scheduled system activation Pre-heater scheduling allowing users to define the start time for solution heating Typical Applications: Cleaning of electronic and optical components Decontamination of laboratory instruments Maintenance of mechanical and hydraulic parts Sample preparation in chemical processes","title":"GENERAL DESCRIPTION"},{"location":"gen_desc.html#general-description","text":"The ultrasonic cleaning bench with heating is a specialised piece of equipment designed to perform deep and efficient cleaning of parts and components through ultrasonic cavitation, combined with controlled heating of the cleaning solution up to 80\u202f\u00b0C.

Below are the steps and components involved in operating the equipment: Power and Lighting Controls The system is energised via a main isolator switch, located on the front panel. This switch must be turned on to supply power to the equipment. Directly below the isolator is a worklight control button, which toggles the illumination of the working area. Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Adjacent to the power panel is the HMI touchscreen, which provides access to all operational commands and real-time system information. Through the HMI, the following functions can be activated: Drain \u2013 initiates the emptying of the cleaning tank. Pre-heating \u2013 starts the heating process to reach the desired bath temperature. Ultrasonic \u2013 activates the ultrasonic cleaning cycle. The main screen of the HMI displays essential operational data and controls, including: Current time Current bath temperature Status indicators for: Ultrasonic operation, Pre-heating activity and Drain function. Function Details The functions available in the system are listed below and can be accessed either by clicking on the screen or by using the physical buttons provided on the HMI. Drain (F1) When the Drain function is activated, the system will automatically disable all heating and ultrasonic operations. It will then wait for the cleaning solution to cool down to a preconfigured safe temperature before initiating the drainage process. This ensures that the solution is discharged safely and prevents damage to components or plumbing due to high temperatures. Pre-heating (F2) Activating the Pre-heating function will start the heating process of the bath until it reaches the pre-set target temperature. This operation will only begin if the water level is sufficient for safe heating. Once the desired temperature is reached, the system will maintain it continuously until the pre-heating function is manually turned off. Note: This function cannot operate while the Drain function is active. Ultrasonic (F4) The Ultrasonic function initiates the ultrasonic cleaning cycle, provided that the Drain function is not active and the minimum water level is present in the tank. Water level detection is managed via nitrogen bubble sensors to ensure safe operation. If the required conditions are not met, the ultrasonic system will remain inactive to protect the equipment and ensure proper cleaning performance. Configuration Page (F3) The HMI includes a configuration page where users can: Set the target temperature for the cleaning bath. Enable and schedule automatic pre-heating , allowing the system to start heating at a predefined time. Adjust the internal clock of the equipment to ensure accurate scheduling and time-based operations. 1 - Setpoint Temperature In this section, you can set the desired water temperature for sterilization together with the ultrasonic function. The maximum temperature that can be reached is 80 \u00b0C. 2 - Auto Preheating When this function is enabled, you can schedule an automatic heating start time. The trigger is defined using the fields below, where you set the hour and minutes. 3 - Curent Time Set For proper operation, it is recommended to adjust the system date and time in the designated fields, using the format dd/mm/yy hh:mm. Water Supply Instructions The ultrasonic cleaning bench requires manual water filling prior to operation. The system does not feature automatic water supply; instead, water must be introduced via the designated valve, as shown in the image. It is essential to ensure that the tank is filled to at least the minimum water level before activating any of the system\u2019s functions. This minimum level is monitored by the nitrogen bubble sensor, and its status is indicated by an LED indicator, also shown in the image. Failure to meet the required water level will prevent the activation of key functions such as Pre-heating and Ultrasonic cleaning , ensuring safe and reliable operation of the equipment.","title":"OPERATION"},{"location":"operation.html#operation","text":"The ultrasonic cleaning bench is equipped with a user-friendly interface and a structured control system to ensure safe and efficient operation.
